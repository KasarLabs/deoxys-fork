# üëΩ Deoxys: Starknet full node client on Substrate

Deoxys is a Starknet *full node* client implementation using rust and leveraging the power of substrate and its community.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We strongly recommend you use [nix](https://nixos.org/download) to set up your development environment.

### Setup with Nix

You will need to have [nix](https://nixos.org/download) installed on your system for this step, with [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) enabled as an experimental feature. 
Then, simply run the following command inside the cloned repository:

```sh
nix develop
```

This will open a new shell session with all the required dependencies. Note that this is not a containerized environment, and local changes to files will persist.

### Manual setup

Make sure to have the following packages installed on your system:
```sh
openssl pkgconfig protobuf clang rocksdb alsa
```

You will also need to have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) configured locally.

## üß™ Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing will require you both compile and run a test node locally. Make sure to have at least 300GB available to store the entirety of the Starknet blockchain history. **This will take time, so do it as soon as possible**.

Testing is done using the [ditto](https://github.com/KasarLabs/ditto) unit testing framework. Refer to that repository's documentation for further information

## üëç Contribute

You are welcome to propose your help for contributions via [onlydust](https://app.onlydust.com/p/deoxys). Contributions will only be accepted via pull request through forks of this repository. Any pull request should be formatted using `cargo fmt` and linted with `cargo clippy` and *will be checked* during integration tests.

## ü§ù Partnerships
